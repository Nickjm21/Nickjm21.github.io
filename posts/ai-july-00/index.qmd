I’ve been building LLM-based apps for a while now, but recently I’ve been wanting to dig deeper - past the APIs and into the nuts and bolts of how these models actually work. So I’m carving out a month (AI July) to dive headfirst into deep learning. Here’s the plan:

## Week 1:
* Read chapters 1-5 of [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai)
* Train NN from scratch on MNIST w/ PyTorch
* Supplemental lectures from [Introduction to Deep Learning](https://introtodeeplearning.com)

## Week 2:
* Find a recent, interesting paper
* Reproduce the results

## Week 3:
* Explore an active research area
* Complete a mini-study on the topic

## Week 4:
* Compile results and share findings

A bit ambitious, but I'm excited to get started! I'll be posting updates [here](https://nickjm21.github.io) as I go at least weekly.
